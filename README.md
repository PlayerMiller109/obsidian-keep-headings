# Keep Headings

中文介绍见 [Obsidian Chinese Forum t38592](https://forum-zh.obsidian.md/t/topic/38592/1)

Keep Headings is a pure JS Obsidian community plugin.
It can update internal links, such as `[[MD#Test]]`,
when renaming a heading `Test` within the note `MD.md`.

When clicking on a heading,
it will trigger a relatively more seamless modal for renaming,
and will auto submit when clicking outside
or pressing Ctrl + Enter.
Press Esc to cancel.

- Won’t trigger on right-click or click with Ctrl or Alt key. For management.
- Data processing fully relies on official “Rename this heading” command. Safe.
- If you accidentally submit an empty heading, though there will be a default “Update link” notice, don't worry as no actual changes will be made.

For the first time to take effect, please switch to another note or restart the software once.
